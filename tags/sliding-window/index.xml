The technique reduces the use of a nested loop and replaces it with a single loop, reducing the time complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sliding window technique is efficient because it avoids unnecessary computations. By moving the window only one step at a time, you avoid repeating calculations already done for the previous window. This can save a lot of time and make the algorithm more efficient.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
