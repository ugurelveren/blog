&lt;p>At my company, we&amp;rsquo;ve been having discussions about finding the best local development environment for our engineering teams. We noticed that inconsistent development setups were slowing down our productivity. So I decided to dig deeper and research the best solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll share what I discovered during my investigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many development teams face the same challenge: inconsistent local environments. Some developers use Docker, others prefer Minikube, and a few try connecting directly to shared clusters. The result? Everyone runs into the same frustrating issues: setups that don&amp;rsquo;t match, hours wasted on &lt;code>&amp;quot;it works on my machine&amp;quot;&lt;/code> problems, and slow feedback when testing code.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
