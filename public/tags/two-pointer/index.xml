      <description>&lt;p&gt;The two-pointer technique is an easy method used to solve some array-related problems. It involves using two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the array and the other from the end, to traverse the array and find a solution. This technique is helpful because it reduces the time complexity of the algorithm and increases its efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two-pointer technique is used in various solutions such as finding the sum of two numbers in an array that equals a given target, finding the length of the longest subarray with a given sum, and finding the shortest subarray with a given sum. The basic idea behind this technique is to start from the two ends of the array and move the pointers towards each other until a solution is found or it becomes clear that a solution does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
