      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late August, southern California faced a mosquito invasion. These tiny pests seemed to appear out of nowhere, leaving their itchy marks on unsuspecting victims. Whether you had a bug screen or not, they found their way into your home, and you&amp;rsquo;d wake up with irritating mosquito bites. At first, you might not notice them, but as time passed, the incessant itching would become undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These mosquitoes were notorious for targeting ankles, leaving small, pink, and itchy bites. Sometimes, you&amp;rsquo;d wake up with not just one or two but possibly three or more bites. The constant itching would make you want to scratch your ankles, especially when walking. It was nearly impossible to scratch them all the time, like when driving, where you&amp;rsquo;d long for relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
