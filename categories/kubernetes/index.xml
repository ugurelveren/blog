&lt;p>At my company, we&amp;rsquo;ve been having discussions about finding the best local development environment for our engineering teams. We noticed that inconsistent development setups were slowing down our productivity. So I decided to dig deeper and research the best solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll share what I discovered during my investigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many development teams face the same challenge: inconsistent local environments. Some developers use Docker, others prefer Minikube, and a few try connecting directly to shared clusters. The result? Everyone runs into the same frustrating issues: setups that don&amp;rsquo;t match, hours wasted on &lt;code>&amp;quot;it works on my machine&amp;quot;&lt;/code> problems, and slow feedback when testing code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is Cloud Native, really?</title><link>https://blog.ugurelveren.com/post/what-is-cloud-native-design/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ugurelveren.com/post/what-is-cloud-native-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.ugurelveren.com/images/CloudNative.png" alt="Illustration of cloud-native architecture showing secure, scalable, and connected cloud services like storage, networking, and compute.

&lt;p>This is one of those topics where everyone seems to have a slightly different view and most of them are valid. That&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of computer science: there&amp;rsquo;s rarely a single right answer. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across some of the many answers out there, and I won&amp;rsquo;t dive into all of them here. It&amp;rsquo;s simply too much to cover in a single article. I want to share my perspective here. For other viewpoints, you can explore online resources and read different takes on the subject.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
